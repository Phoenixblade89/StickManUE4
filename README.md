# StickManUE4


**Project Name**: StickMan <br />
**Project Leader/Software Lead**: Jonathan Essary aka Phoenixblade89

**Objective** <br />
	The objective of this project is to show proficiency in the C++ programming language through developing a simple game. This game, StickMan,will consist of one stage. The player will be able to navigate StickMan through the level, pick-up coins which will increment a counter on the upper right hand side of the HUD(Heads Up Display), and finally open a door to the “finish line”. In order to accomplish this goal in the time provided for the class I will be making use of the 2D Side Scroller template provided by UE4.

**Minimum Viable Product**<br />
	To meet the “Clear Outcome” of this project and provide the minimum viable product the following must be completed:

<ol>1) StickMan must install on a system other than the developers system.</ol>
<ol>2) StickMan must move and be controllable by the user.</ol>
<ol>3) StickMan must be able to pick up coins in the game world which increment a counter on screen. </ol>
<ol>4) StickMan must be able to pass into a “finish line” and show the user that they have completed the demo. </ol>

**Stretch Goals**<br />
	If all MVP(Minimum Viable Product) goals have been met and time allows, the following stretch goals will be pursued:

<ol>1) Add enemy AI that StickMan must fight using a projectile attack.</ol>
<ol>2) Enemy AI will drop additional coins or power-ups for the projectile attack.</ol>
<ol>3) Add new environmental hazards which can kill StickMan forcing a level restart.</ol>
<ol>4) Add assets provided by an outside source (Unreal Marketplace) to give a more professional appearance.
</ol>

**Project Due Date**: December 14, 2016
